I caught a small mulloway on a small live tommy in about 1minute of casting. It was a very snaggy area so we moved to the next hole to the right of the mouth. Ken landed a small mulloway on live mullet and was also bitten of by a big fish. I hooked a massive eagle ray and landed it after a 20-30min fight.",
